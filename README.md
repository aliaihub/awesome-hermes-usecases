**A community collection of real-world [Hermes Agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent) use cases — each one backed by public evidence.**

| | This Catalog | Official Docs | X Threads | Reddit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Organized by category | ✅ | Partial | ❌ | ❌ |

> [!NOTE]
> **Evidence rule.** Every use case here links to a primary source: an official Hermes doc, a Nous Research companion repo, a GitHub issue with deployment details, or a first-person blog post. If the only evidence is a tweet or "community build" marketing page, it lives in [`research/unverified.md`](research/unverified.md) instead — not in the catalog below.

## Quick start

New to Hermes Agent? The fastest path:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
hermes setup
```

Then pick a use case below. The [`/demos`](demos/) folder has three runnable starters: [Daily Briefing](demos/daily-briefing/), [Open WebUI](demos/openwebui/), and [Team Telegram](demos/team-telegram/).

| [GitHub PR Review (webhook)](usecases/github-pr-review-webhook.md) | Real-time PR comments via a signed GitHub webhook. End-to-end event-driven code review. |
| [Production Software-Dev Workflow](usecases/production-software-dev-workflow.md) | A field report of daily production development on Hermes — long sessions, delegation, memory, one 12-hour run with ~2.6M replay tokens. |
| [Local Model Quantization with TurboQuant](usecases/dev-local-model-quantization.md) | Optimize MLX models (Qwen3.5-9B) for local Apple Silicon inference using domain-specific skills — apply, benchmark, document, publish. |

## Frontends & UIs

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Open WebUI Frontend](usecases/open-webui-frontend.md) | Point Open WebUI at the Hermes API server to get a full browser chat frontend for the agent, with session continuity. |
| [TUI Operator Console](usecases/tui-operator-console.md) | Keyboard-first terminal HUD for managing your agent — live sessions, skills toggle, cron, logs, config editing, multiple themes. |

## Home & Device Control

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Home Assistant Control](usecases/home-assistant-control.md) | Conversational control of a smart home via four built-in HA tools — list entities, read state, call services. |
| [Android Device Control](usecases/android-device-control.md) | Remote phone control from a Hermes chat — 36 `android_*` tools for taps, swipes, screenshots, and screen reading via a relay app. |

## Content & Creative Pipelines

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Autonovel — House of Bells](usecases/autonovel-house-of-bells.md) | End-to-end autonomous novel, art, and audiobook production. Nous Research's own pipeline shipped a 19-chapter, 79,456-word book with an audiobook and a website. |
| [Printing-Factory Task Memory](usecases/printing-factory-task-memory.md) | A custom skill that fixes long-context slowness and forgetting during daily factory operations. Local JSON index with sub-second retrieval. |
| [Screen Recording → Tutorial Video](usecases/creative-screen-recording-video.md) | Feed Hermes a raw screen recording and get a finished tutorial video on HeyGen with your AI avatar — script generation, video production, and memory of preferences for repeat work. |
| [ComfyUI Workflow Orchestration](usecases/comfyui-workflow-orchestration.md) | Install, launch, and run ComfyUI node-based media generation workflows on demand — from Stable Diffusion to video pipelines, with automatic custom-node installation and deterministic output management. |
| [AI Video Generation: HTML-to-MP4](usecases/video-generation-html-to-mp4.md) | Hermes writes designed HTML compositions (via Open Design), then renders to MP4 via HyperFrames — GSAP animations, shader transitions, TTS narration, all code-driven with no timeline editor. |

## Orchestration & Multi-Agent

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Paperclip Managed Employee](usecases/paperclip-managed-employee.md) | Hermes running as a worker inside Nous Research's Paperclip task-orchestration system, with persistent sessions and checkpoints. |
| [Self-Evolution](usecases/self-evolution.md) | A GEPA + DSPy loop that optimizes your Hermes skills, prompts, and tool text, producing PR-ready improvements for a few dollars per run. |

| [Matt Pocock Skills + Sub-Agents](usecases/matt-pocock-skills-subagents.md) | Use Matt Pocock's open-source skills (`/grill-me`, `/to-prd`, `/to-issues`) for planning and scoping, then Hermes sub-agents for parallel implementation of vertical-sliced issues — with HITL gates to stop AI slop before it ships. |

## Memory & Context

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [YantrikDB Cognitive Memory (via MCP)](usecases/yantrikdb-memory-mcp.md) | Replace or augment native memory with a dedicated cognitive DB — vector + knowledge graph + temporal decay + contradiction detection. Integrates over MCP, so no Hermes plugin needed. |

## Deployment Patterns

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Hermes on Fly.io](usecases/hermes-on-flyio.md) | Official Fly-apps deployment guide — run Hermes as a Fly Machine with a volume-backed `/opt/data`, daily snapshots, and ~$15/month baseline. |
| [Local & Proxy Model Backends](usecases/local-and-proxy-models.md) | Run Hermes against Ollama, vLLM, oMLX, or a custom OpenAI-compatible proxy — for cost control, data locality, or model choice beyond the defaults. |
| [Local Model Auto-Detection](usecases/local-model-auto-detection.md) | Hermes probes your local inference server, identifies the running model, detects context window, and auto-configures — eliminates first-setup friction for Ollama, llama.cpp, MLX, and vLLM. |

## Research & Training

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Multi-Platform Social Media Research](usecases/multi-platform-research.md) | Run a single query across Reddit, X/Twitter, YouTube, Hacker News, and Polymarket via a single Python engine.
